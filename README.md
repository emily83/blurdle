### How To Play

Guess the famous person from the blurry photo.

You have 6 guesses and must answer with the full name.

After each wrong guess or pass, the photo will get less blurry.

Guess in as few guesses as possible and share your score!

### Built With

The site is built on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and uses AWS S3.

### Project Architecture

The front end of the website uses React. State is managed using the Context API.

The back end uses Node.js with Express. A MongoDB database holds the data for the game, including the url for each day's picture for guessing. Mongoose is used for interacting with the database.

The daily pictures are stored in an AWS S3 cloud storage bucket. The picture is retrieved from S3 then blurred using the Jimp image processing library and returned in JSON from the API to be consumed by the client.

There is an admin panel for adding the daily pictures which uses Passport as authentication middleware and JSON web tokens.

   ```

4. Install client NPM packages

   ```sh
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

5. Create config file `config/config.env`
   ```js
   NODE_ENV = development;
   PORT = 5000;
   MONGO_URI_TEST = YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING;
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY;
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = YOUR_SECRET_KEY;
   S3_BUCKET_TEST = blurdle - test;
   ```
